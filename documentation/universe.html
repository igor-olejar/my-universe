		<h2>Application Description</h2>
		<em>My Universe</em> is a Facebook application, written in PHP using the CodeIgniter framework. Its purpose is to analyse the available
		Facebook data of the Facebook user and his or her significant other, and produce a list of common photos, videos, wall posts, music, events, likes and
		checkins. This list can be shared by the user with his or her significant other.
	</p>

		<h2>Application configuration</h2>
		The application utilises CodeIgniter's configuration files located in the <em>application/config</em> folder.
		<h3><em>application/config/autoload.php</em></h3>
		This file autoloads the following libraries: database, session, facebook, template, form validation.<br />
		The file also autoloads the following helpers: url, form, array, and html.
		
		<h3><em>application/config/database.php</em></h3>
		This file contains the MySQL database settings (username, password, hostname, etc.).
		
		<h3><em>application/config/config.php</em></h3>
		This is where the general application settings are. This file also contains the <kbd>specific settings</kbd> for the application, which
		should be changed when deployed:
		<h4>Application Title</h4>
		Application title is stored in <dfn>$config['app_title'] = 'My Universe'</dfn>.
		<h4>Facebook Permissions</h4>
		<dfn>$config['fb_perms']</dfn> array contains the list of permissions without which the application won't work.
		<h4>Singles array</h4>
		<dfn>$config['singles_array']</dfn> contains the list of relationship statuses which are considered as 'single' or 'not in a relationship'.
		<h4>Music applications</h4>
		Each music-related application on Facebook has an ID and <dfn>$config['music_apps']</dfn> lists them (see the Timelines model).
		<h4>Multiple Timelines</h4>
		The <dfn>$config['multiple']</dfn> switch (TRUE or FALSE) controls whether each user can have multiple entries in the database.
		<h4>Post Message</h4>
		The text of the message used when sharing the application link is set here: <dfn>$config['post_message']</dfn>
		
		<h3><em>application/config/config.php</em></h3>
		This file contains the application ID and the 'secret' (provided by Facebook).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<h2>Facebook permissions</h2>
		The application needs to retrieve and analyse a large amount of user's personal data. Therefore, when the user first authorises the application, he or
		she will have to give the following permissions:
		<ul>
			<li>user_about_me</li>
			<li>user_activities</li>
			<li>user_status</li>
			<li>user_events</li>
			<li>user_likes</li>
			<li>user_photos</li>
			<li>user_relationships</li>
			<li>user_videos</li>
			<li>user_actions.music</li>
			<li>user_actions.video</li>
			<li>user_checkins</li>
			<li>friends_activities</li>
			<li>friends_status</li>
			<li>friends_events</li>
			<li>friends_likes</li>
			<li>friends_photos</li>
			<li>friends_checkins</li>
			<li>read_stream</li>
			<li>publish_stream</li>
		</ul>
		Without these, the application will not be able to access the necessary data nor post on the user's behalf. This list of permissions is used as the "scope"
		property in the Facebook login button on the landing page (see Views).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<h2>Database and Migrations</h2>
		The application utilises a MySQL database called "universe" to store the list of shared Facebook activities for later retrieval by the user's partner.
		In its first version, the database consists of two tables: <dfn>user</dfn> and <dfn>timelines</dfn>. The <dfn>user</dfn> table contains the basic information
		about the first (the one who creates the list) user, such as name and Facebook user ID.
		
		<code>
			CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `user` (<br />
  `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,<br />
  `user_fb_id` varchar(255) character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,<br />
  `user_name` varchar(255) character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,<br />
  `created_on` timestamp NOT NULL default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,<br />
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)<br />
) ENGINE=MyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT=3 ;<br />
		</code>
		
		The <dfn>timelines</dfn> table contains information on each created common timeline, including partner's name and Facebook ID.
		<code>
			CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `timelines` (<br />
  `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,<br />
  `hashvalue` varchar(40) character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,<br />
  `user_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL COMMENT 'Not the FB ID',<br />
  `partner_fb_id` varchar(255) character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,<br />
  `partner_name` varchar(255) character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,<br />
  `photos` mediumtext character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci,<br />
  `videos` mediumtext character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci,<br />
  `posts` mediumtext character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci,<br />
  `music` mediumtext character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci,<br />
  `events` mediumtext character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci,<br />
  `likes` mediumtext character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci,<br />
  `checkins` mediumtext character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci,<br />
  `created` timestamp NOT NULL default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP on update CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,<br />
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`),<br />
  KEY `hashvalue` (`hashvalue`),<br />
  KEY `user_id` (`user_id`)<br />
) ENGINE=MyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT=8 ;<br />
		</code>
		Lists of photos, videos, etc. are stored as serialised arrays.<br /><br />
		In order to simplify the database installation and track any changes, CodeIgniter's Migrations are used. (see http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/migration.html).
		Simply run the Migrate controller (<em>application/controllers/migrate.php</em>) to install the latest version of the database.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<h2>Controllers</h2>
		<h1>Welcome</h1>
		This is the first controller in the application. It checks whether the user is logged in. If no, the login button is displayed. If yes,
		the controller gets the user's name, relationship status (via the 'singles' list, as explained Application Configuration), significant other's details,
		list of friends and displays the <em>select_partner</em> form.<br /><br />
		This controller is associated with the <em>Welcome_model</em> and <em>landing</em> view.
		
		<h1>Animation</h1>
		Animation controller processes the <em>select_partner</em> form.
		<ol>
			<li>Person is 'single': the user must select a friend from the given drop-down menu. Once selected and form submitted, this friend becomes
			the <em>chosen partner</em>. If no friend is selected, the application displays an error and the form again.</li>
			<li>
				Person is 'in relationship': such a user can either continue with the 'significant other' found by the <em>Welcome</em> controller, or
				choose someone from the list of friends. The 'significant other' found by the <em>Welcome</em> controller becomes the <em>chosen partner</em>
				 by default. However, if the user chooses someone else from the list of friends, this new person becomes the <em>chosen partner</em>.
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h1>Migrate</h1>
		This controller is used only for installing the database (explained above) and should be removed from the final installation.
		
		<h1>Timelines</h1>
		This controller queries Facebook and analyses the received data via the <em>Timelines Model</em> (see below). It also has the <dfn>share</dfn> method,
		which allows the user to share the timelines with the 'chosen partner'.
		
		<h1>Show</h1>
		<em>Show</em> controller uses its <dfn>timeline</dfn> method to read a timeline from the database and show it to the 'chosen partner'. The method receives a
		hashvalue, which is checked for validity. Each shared timeline is represented by a unique hashvalue.
		Furthermore, the method checks whether the currently logged-in Facebook user is listed as one of the two people
		associated with the hashvalue. If not, the landing page is displayed. If yes, the shared timeline is shown.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<h2>Models</h2>
		<h1>Welcome Model</h1>
		This model is associated with the <em>Welcome</em> controller and has these methods:
		<h3><dfn>getFbFriends()</dfn></h3>
		Returns the list of current user's friends.
		
		<h3><dfn>previousTimelineExists()</dfn></h3>
		Determines whether the current user has already created a shared timeline. Returns <dfn>TRUE</dfn> or <dfn>FALSE</dfn>.
		
		<h1>Timelines Model</h1>
		This model queries Facebook for all the data that is to be analysed. It uses a batch request with a combination of FQL and Graph API to optimise the
		queries. The following are the methods and their logic:
		
		<h3><dfn>getData()</dfn></h3>
		Performs the actual request and dissects the generated <em>json</em> array into following arrays: photos, videos, user_wall, partner_wall, user_music,
		partner_music, user_events, partner_events, user_likes, partner_likes, and checkins.
		
		<h3><dfn>getPhotos()</dfn></h3>
		Returns the list of photos where both partners are tagged. It goes through the list of user's photos and checks that the photos are posted by either the user or
		the partner, and that one or both of them are tagged.
		
		<h3><dfn>getVideos()</dfn></h3>
		Operates in the same way as the getPhotos() method.
		
		<h3><dfn>getPosts()</dfn></h3>
		Analyses the user's and partner's walls. For the user, it finds the lists of user's posts where the partner is either tagged, has liked the post or has
		commented on the post. A reciprocal list is found for the partner. The intersection of the two lists is returned as the list of shared posts.
		
		<h3><dfn>getCheckins()</dfn></h3>
		Returns the list of user's posts ('streams') where either partner is mentioned and the parameter <em>place</em> is not empty (FQL query).
		
		<h3><dfn>getLikes()</dfn></h3>
		Returns the intersection of user's and partner's lists of 'likes' (list of Facebook IDs).
		
		<h3><dfn>getEvents()</dfn></h3>
		Finds the lists of events attended (marked as 'attended' in Facebook) by the user and by the partner. Returns the list of event IDs that exist both the
		user's and the partner's lists.
		
		<h3><dfn>getMusic()</dfn></h3>
		A music-related post is just a regular post that has app_id which is listed in the <em>config.php</em> file. Similar to the above method, this one
		finds the list of such posts for the user and the partner and returns the intersection as a list of URLs.
		
		<h1>Show Model</h1>
		This model is associated with the <em>Show controller</em> and has the following methods:
		<h3><dfn>getData()</dfn></h3>
		For the given hashvalue, it queries the database and returns arrays of data (photos, videos, likes, etc.).
		
		<h3><dfn>checkUserId()</dfn></h3>
		For the given hashvalue and the current Facebook user ID, it checks whether the user ID is associated with the hashvalue. It checks both the user and the
		partner IDs. If either matches, it returns <dfn>TRUE</dfn>; otherwise, it returns <dfn>FALSE</dfn>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<h2>Views</h2>
		Views reside in the <em>application/views/</em> folder, with each view being wrapped by the header and footer, found in <em>application/view/includes/</em>.
		
		<h3>landing.php</h3>
		This is the landing view, shown by the <em>Welcome Controller</em>. It displays the Facebook login button if the user is not logged in, and the
		<em>select_partner.form.php</em> if the user is logged in.
		
		<h3>animation.php</h3>
		This view shows which partner was chosen and provides the link to the shared timelines. Normally, this view will either be skipped or overlaid by an
		animation.
		
		<h3>timelines.php</h3>
		Displays the list of Facebook IDs that represent the shared photos, videos, events, etc. It also shows the logout and "share" links.
		
		<h3>timeline.php</h3>
		This view is used by the partner to view the shared timelines. It either displays the Facebook login button (if the user isn't logged in), or the list
		of shared Facebook IDs (by including the <em>application/views/includes/timeline_details.php</em> sub-view).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<h2>Custom libraries</h2>
		Facebook API is included as a library and is automatically loaded with each controller.<br /><br />
		A custom <dfn>Template</dfn> class is used to wrap each view with the header and footer automatically.
